# **Telecom Customer Churn Analysis â€“ Excel Dashboard Project**  

## **Overview**  
This project analyzes customer churn in a telecom company using Excel dashboards. The dataset includes customer demographics, service details, and billing information to identify churn patterns and key influencing factors. Various Excel formulas, including `COUNTIFS` and `AVERAGEIFS`, were used for data analysis.  

## **Dashboards**  

### **1. Overview Dashboard**  
- Displays total churn percentage (**26%**), with most churn occurring before the one-year mark.  
- Higher average monthly charges were linked to churn.  
- **47% of churned customers left after staying for more than a year.**  

### **2. Demographics Dashboard**  
- **Senior citizens, customers without dependents, and customers without partners had higher churn rates.**  
- The churn rate for males and females was almost equal, making gender a non-factor.  

### **3. Services Dashboard**  
- **Customers with internet service churned more than those without.**  
- Among internet users, **69% of fiber optic users churned**, while DSL users had lower churn.  
- **73% of churned customers had no tech support**, **76% lacked online security**, **65% had no online backup**, and **63% had unprotected devices.**  
- **Contract type and payment method were also major churn factors:**
  - **Month-to-month contracts had the highest churn**, while one-year and two-year contracts had lower churn rates.  
  - **Electronic check payments had the highest churn rate**, while customers using automatic credit card deductions churned the least.  

### **4. Churn Factors Dashboard**  
- **Interactive slicers** for internet service type, partner status, and dependent status.  
- **Churn was highest among fiber optic users who lacked security services, tech support, or device protection.**  
- **Overall, customers on month-to-month contracts and those paying via electronic checks had the highest churn rates, independent of internet type.**  

## **Suggestions to Reduce Churn**  
Based on the analysis, the telecom company can implement the following strategies to improve customer retention:
